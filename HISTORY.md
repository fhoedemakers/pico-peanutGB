# History of changes

# v0.8 Release Notes

- Settings are saved to /settings_gb.dat instead of /settings.dat. This allows to have separate settings files for different emulators (e.g. pico-infonesPlus and pico-peanutGB etc.).
- Added a settings menu.
  - Main menu: press SELECT to open; adjust options without using in-game button combos.
  - In-game: press SELECT+START to open; from here you can also quit from the game.
- Switched to Fatfs R0.16.

## Fixes

- Show correct buttonlabels in menus.
- removed wrappers for f_chdir en f_cwd, fixed in Fatfs R0.16. (there was a long standing issue with f_chdir and f_cwd not working with exFAT formatted SD cards.)

# v0.7 Release Notes

- Game Boy Color games can be played now.
- In-game hotkeys are now consistent with the other emulators. 
- Themed borders/bezels are shown in-game. For this you need the latest [metadata pack](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-peanutGB/releases/latest/download/GBMetadata.zip) from the releases section. Download and unzip it's contents to the root of the SD card.
- Support for [Retro-bit 8 button Genesis-USB](https://www.retro-bit.com/controllers/genesis/#usb). 
- Added support for [Adafruit Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200):  
  - Uses HSTX for video output.  
  - Audio is not supported over HSTX — connect speakers via the **audio jack** or the **4–8 Ω speaker connector**.  
  - Audio is simultaneousy played through speaker and jack. Speaker audio can be muted with **Button 1**.  
  - Controller options:  
    - **USB gamepad** on USB 1.  
    - **Wii Classic controller** via [Adafruit Wii Nunchuck Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4836) on the STEMMA QT port.  
  - Scanlines can be toggled with **SELECT + UP**.  
  - NeoPixel leds act as a VU meter. Can be toggled on or of via Button2 on the Fruit Jam, or SELECT + RIGHT on the controller.

- Added support for [Waveshare RP2350-PiZero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-pizero.htm):  
  - Gamepad must be connected via the **PIO USB port**.  
  - The built-in USB port is now dedicated to **power and firmware flashing**, removing the need for a USB-Y cable.  
  - Optional: when you solder the optional PSRAM chip on the board, the emulator will make use of it. Roms will be loaded much faster using PSRAM.

- Added support for Waveshare RP2350-USBA with PCB. More info and build guide at: https://www.instructables.com/PicoNES-RaspberryPi-Pico-Based-NES-Emulator/
- Added support for [Spotpear HDMI](https://spotpear.com/index/product/detail/id/1207.html) board.

- Framebuffer implemented in SRAM. This eliminates the red flicker during slow operations, such as SD card I/O.

- **Cover art and metadata support**:  
  - Download pack [here](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-peanutGB/releases/latest/download/GBMetadata.zip).  
  - Extract the zip contents to the **root of the SD card**.  
  - In the menu:  
    - Highlight a game and press **START** → show cover art and metadata.  
    - Press **SELECT** → show full game description.  
    - Press **B** → return to menu.  
    - Press **START** or **A** → start the game.

- Screensaver
  - Block screensaver, which is shown when no metadata is available, is replaced by static floating image.

Huge thanks to [Gavin Knight](https://github.com/DynaMight1124) for providing the metadata and images as well as testing the different builds!
